         <h2>Recommendations to lead a healthy lifestyle</h2>
         <p> There are many ways a person's lifestyle can be negatively affected, simply because of a lack of knowledge
            or absolute disregard of their health. The following will give you an idea of what can be done to improve yourself
            physically and mentally.
         </p>
         <h3>Improve your sleep</h3>
         <p>If you’re having trouble sleeping, try cutting out alcohol or caffeine and other such stimulants, as this can help you to nod off and get a good night’s sleep. Also, adding a few drops of lavender oil onto your pillow at night has been shown to have relaxing effects.</p>
         <h3>Cut down on your salt intake</h3>
         <p>To reduce the impact of salt on your blood pressure, cut down on your salt intake. We suggest using herbs and spices such as oregano, nutmeg and paprika to season your food, rather than always adding salt. You may eventually find that you don’t need to add salt at all!</p>
         <h3>Enjoy a glass of wine</h3>
         <p>Drinking just one or two glasses of wine a day is thought to cut your risk of heart disease by up to a third. Make sure you go for red or rosé variety, as they contain much higher levels of antioxidants than your average glass of white wine.</p>
         <h3>Eat a high fiber diet</h3>
         <p>Fibre aids the digestive system by helping to speed up the passage of waste material through the body — thereby ensuring that cancer-causing substances do not stay long enough in the bowels to have any damaging effects.</p>
         <h3>Have a good laugh</h3>
         <p>Laughing can help to boost blood flow by more than 20 per cent, and researchers say it may reduce the risk of developing heart disease. Laughing can also help to fight infections, relieve hay fever, ease pain and control diabetes.</p>
         <h3>Fruits for immunity and blood pressure</h3>
         <p>Fruits such as oranges, lemons, and grapefruit are a great source of vitamin C, which helps to boost the immune system. Also, citrus fruits and bananas are a good source of potassium, which can help to regulate blood pressure.</p>
         <h3>Eat more garlic</h3>
         <p>Garlic is a powerful cleanser of the body. Regular consumption of garlic (either in natural form or odourless capsules) promotes a healthy heart and good circulation by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol — and it also helps to fight infection and boost the body’s immunity.</p>
         <h3>Keep your brain active</h3>
         <p>Doing a mentally challenging activity — such as reading a book or completing a crossword or Sudoku puzzle — will help to keep your brain functioning at a high level. People who do less mentally challenging activities generally show more brain degeneration earlier on in life — so get testing your brainpower!</p>
