            <h3> What is a healthy Diet? </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            A great start in introducing healthy dietary habits is by first defining a healthy diet. A healthy diet 
            is defined as one that helps to maintain or improve general health; i.e. consumption of the adequate
            quantities of food from all food groups in order to lead a healthy life. Various nutrition guides					  
            are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate the public on what they should be 
            eating to promote health. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers 
            to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.

            <h3> Dietary habits in Trinidad and Tobago </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            It is a ranking that no one in this country should be proud of—Trinidad and Tobago is the third fattest country in the world.
            According to data released in July 2013, only Kuwait and the United States rank higher than this country in those global 
            estimates. Trinidad and Tobago made it onto the list carried out by the United Nation's because at least 60 per cent of our 
            population of 1.3 million is obese and the situation has been getting worse in the past decade and a half, with the country’s
            obesity index increasing from around 20 per cent to 60 per cent of adults and 30 per cent of children under 15.
            These sobering facts now underscore the need for controlling obesity to be high on the national health agenda.
            People are considered overweight if their body mass index (BMI) is 25 or higher and they are obese with a BMI of
            30 or higher. This is the result of unhealthy eating or activity habits and means higher risk for diabetes, high 
            blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, strokes and other conditions.

            <h3> Government's response to uprising obesity levels </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            Minister of Health, Dr. Fuad Khan, as well as First Lady, Reema Carmona, have since addressed the disconcerting issue; both
            parties urging the masses to reconsider their routine diets and incorporate healthy eating habits into their lifestyle. Despite
            their pleas however, it is ultimately  entirely up to the residents of Trinidad and Tobago to make the decision to create a 
            healthier lifestyle for themselves. Early in Dr. Faud Khan's tenure as minister he introduced initiatives like the Fight the 
            Fat campaign to encourage healthy eating  habits and active lifestyles. His approach of prevention rather than cure is just 
            what is needed in this developing country. However, according to the minister, there is not enough funding for these programmes 
            to have the necessary reach and impact needed to quickly reverse the obesity problem. The aim should be to achieve lower
            rates of obesity so that more citizens enjoy better health and there is lower health care spending per capita. This will 
            require not just a sustained effort from the Health Ministry but other ministries and agencies as well, to increase public 
            awareness of the dangers of obesity and encourage healthier lifestyles.

            <h3> How do I improve my diet to Achieve Healthy Living? </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            Basic steps can be implemented into your diet than can considerably increase your health.
            They are as follows:	
         </p>
         <div class="healthtips">
            <h3> Choose Good Carbs </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            Simple carbs, like sugar and flour, are quickly absorbed by the body's digestive system. This causes a kind of carb overload,
            and your body releases huge amounts of insulin to combat the overload. Eat these in moderation. complex carbs. Complex carbs, 
            on the other hand, are slowly digested by the body. They include whole-grain flour, hearty vegetables, oats, and unprocessed 
            grains like brown rice. These foods are usually higher in vitamins and other nutrients that are beneficial to the body, and 
            they are higher in fiber (which keeps your digestive system running smoothly).                                                                   
         </p>
         <div class="healthtips">
            <h3> Mean, Lean Protein </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            Animal protein and vegetable protein probably have the same effects on health. It’s the protein package that’s likely to 
            make a  difference. A 6-ounce broiled porterhouse steak is a great source of protein—about 40 grams worth. But it also 
            delivers about 38 grams of fat, 14 of them saturated. That’s more than 60 percent of the recommended daily intake for 
            saturated fat. The same amount of salmon gives you 34 grams of protein and 18 grams of fat, 4 of them saturated. A cup 
            of cooked lentils has 18 grams of protein, but under 1 gram of fat. So when choosing protein-rich foods, pay attention
            to what comes along with the protein. Vegetable sources of protein, such as beans, nuts, and whole grains, are excellent
            choices, and they offer healthy fiber, vitamins and minerals. The best animal protein choices are fish and poultry. 
            If you are partial to red meat, stick with the leanest cuts, choose moderate portion sizes, and make it only an occasional
            part of your diet.

            <h3> Know your Fats </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            For years, nutritionists and doctors have preached that a low-fat diet is the key to losing weight, managing cholesterol,
            and preventing health problems. But more than just the amount of fat, it’s the types of fat you eat that really matter. 
            Bad fats increase cholesterol and your risk of certain diseases, while good fats protect your heart and support overall 
            health. In fact, good fats—such as omega-3 fats—are essential to physical and emotional health. Despite what you may 
            have been told, fat isn’t always the bad guy in the waistline wars. Bad fats, such as saturated fats and trans fats, 
            are guilty of the unhealthy things all fats have been blamed for—weight gain, clogged arteries, and so forth. But good
            fats such as the monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, and omega-3s have the opposite effect. In fact, healthy 
            fats play a huge role in helping you manage your moods, stay on top of your mental game, fight fatigue, and even 
            control your weight. As a matter of fact, healthy fats play a huge role in helping you manage your moods, stay on top
            of your mental game, fight fatigue, and even control your weight. The answer isn’t cutting out the fat—it’s learning
            to make healthy choices and to replace bad fats with good ones that promote health and well-being. The best examples
            of good fats are Omega-3s, which can be found in some forms of wild fish (like salmon and herring), flaxseeds and 
            their oil, walnuts and pumpkin seeds, to name a few.Even saturated fats have been found to potentially have some
            examples of good fats like coconut and coconut milk, while other sources should be limited, like lamb and pork.

            <h3> Fruits and Veggies </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            Fruits and vegetables are part of a well-balanced and healthy eating plan. There are many different ways to lose or maintain
            a healthy weight. Using more fruits and vegetables along with whole grains and lean meats, nuts, and beans is a safe and 
            healthy one. Helping control your weight is not the only benefit of eating more fruits and vegetables. Diets rich in fruits 
            and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer and other chronic diseases. Fruits and vegetables also provide 
            essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, and other substances that are important for good health. It’s hard to argue with 
            the health benefits of a diet rich in vegetables and fruits: Lower blood pressure; reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, 
            and probably some cancers; lower risk of eye and digestive problems; and a mellowing effect on blood sugar that can help 
            keep appetite in check.Most people should aim for at least nine servings (at least 4½ cups) of vegetables and fruits a day,
            and potatoes don’t count. Go for a variety of kinds and colors of produce, to give your body the mix of nutrients it needs.
            Best bets? Dark leafy greens, cooked tomatoes, and anything that’s a rich yellow, orange, or red color.

            <h3> Ease up on the Salt </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            Too much salt can raise your blood pressure, which puts you at increased risk of health problems such as heart disease and 
            stroke. But a few simple steps can help you to cut your salt intake. You don't have to add salt to food to be eating too 
            much – 75% of the salt we eat is already in everyday foods such as bread, breakfast cereal and ready meals. A diet that is 
            high in salt can cause raised blood pressure, which currently affects around one third of adults in the United Kingdom. High blood
            pressure often has no symptoms. But if you have it, you are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke. Cutting
            down on salt lowers blood pressure, which means that your risk of having a stroke or developing heart disease is reduced.

            <h3> More Water, Less Soft Drinks </h3>
         </div>
         <p>				  
            Drinking too much soda can cause an array of negative effects in your body, even if you drink diet soda. Carbonated soda drinks
            do not contain any beneficial nutrients, but typically contribute excessive calories and sugar to your diet. Start swapping out
            one soda per day for a bottle of water. Many varieties of water are carbonated and flavored to mimic soda, without providing all
            of the unnecessary calories and sugar. Drinking water on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning, helps flush out any toxins 
            in your colon. In a way, your colon is ready to take in all the good nutrients you plan to feed your body for the day. Your body 
            makes new cells everyday and drinking water helps production of these new cells. This allows your muscles to grow and tone up 
            faster after exercising. Last but not least, When you are ill, staying hydrated is a must. Water not only fights infections but 
            helps you get better soon. Also, when your headaches are caused due to dehydration, water helps you get well soon. So whenever 
            you're not feeling well, drink a glass or two of water before you start popping pills.
