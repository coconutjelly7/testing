         <h2>Smoking</h2>
         <p>An all too common practice in the world, smoking is one of the biggest causes of health related problems. It is one of the leading causes of preventable death globally. While many people use it for the short term effect of stress relief, it comes at a price. Some common effects include reduced lifespans, cancer, increased rate of infection and impotence.</p>
         <p>The reason for this is lies in the components of a cigarette. The most damaging products found in cigarettes are:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>tar</li>
            <li>nicotine</li>
            <li>carbon monoxide</li>
            <li>various gases and particulates that cause Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD)</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Major Diseases caused by Smoking</h3>
         <img src="img\smokerisk.png" alt="risk" />
         <br />
         <p><b>Cancer</b></p>
         <p>Nicotine and tar are carcinogens (cancer causing agents). Smoking can cause cancers of the mouth, throat and lungs. This is supported by the fact that non-smokers are hardly ever affected by the by these types of cancer.</p>
         <p>Different studies show that smoking also increases the development of other forms of cancer such as:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>bladder</li>
            <li>kidneys</li>
            <li>cervical</li>
            <li>pancreas</li>
         </ul>
         <br />
         <p><b>Cardiovascular Disease</b></p>
         <p>This is mainly as a result of the hardening of arteries. This occurs when cholesterol and other fats are deposited in them leaving them blocked, narrow or rigid. This process is one that takes years to develop and is commonly referred to as atherosclerosis. Blood clots are likely to be formed.</p>
         <p>Smoking greatly accelerates this hardening and narrowing process in the arteries, causing blood clots to occur more frequently. This disease is quite fatal as blood clots can block arteries supplying blood to vital organs such as the brain or heart.</p>
         <p>There are many different forms of Cardiovascular disease and many of them are common in smokers.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Cerebral Thrombosis: Result of blocked blood vessels in the brain which can cause strokes, paralysis or collapse</li>
            <li>High Blood Pressure: Affected arteries in the kidneys can lead to this or even kidney failure</li>
            <li>Coronary Thrombosis: Blocked vessels in the heart leading to increased risk of heart attacks</li>
         </ul>
         <br />
         <p><b>COPD</b></p>
         <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease defined by persistently poor airflow as a result of breakdown of lung tissue and dysfunction of the small airways. These conditions are:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Emphysema: Breathlessness caused by the damage to the air sacs(alveoli) found in the lungs</li>
            <li>Chronic Bronchitis: Inflammation of the bronchi which causes a persistent cough containing a lot of mucus for over 3 months</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Smoking is most common cause of these conditions, more so than any other factor. In smokers the rate of decline of lung function is increased by as much as 3 times. Severe cases of this condition can lead to hospitalisation and eventually death. Lung damage caused by COPD is permanent but quitting smoking can reduce the rate at which this occurs.</p>
