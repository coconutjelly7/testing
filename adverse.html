         <p>Health as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Everyday we are bombarded with information and advertisements about healthy living as well products and ways which promote a healthy lifestyle. </p>
         <p>While this helps us to live out healthy lives, we must also understand what factors can cause adverse effects to our well-being. This section intends to inform you about some very common detriments to your health and to help you make a better decision.</p>
         <br />
         <p>Below are 2 common practices which can negatively affect your health:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="smoking.html">Smoking</a></li>
            <li><a href="drinking.html">Drinking</a></li>
         </ul>
         <p>While there are many other factors that can also have adverse health effects, these 2 are the most common and preventable causes.</p>
