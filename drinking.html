         <h2>Drinking</h2>
         <p>This is another common health related problem that is easily preventable. While drinking once in while does not have any great effect on one's health, excessive drinking can pose quite a problem. Alcohol is a drug, and it is one can easily cause addiction depending on the user. Even those with a high alcohol tolerance level are not immune to the effects caused by it.</p>
         <p>Because of the way alcohol affects health, it would be easier to show what it can to different parts of the body. Here are some ways in which alcohol affects the body:</p>
         <br />
         <p><b>Brain</b></p>
         <p>Alcohol affects the way the brain works. This can result in lack of coordination, poor judgement and can affect ones mood and behaviour. This can commonly be seen in people who get drunk over a couple of drinks. Other effects include depression, anxiety, shortened attention span, coma and even death.</p>
         <br />
         <p><b>Heart</b></p>
         <p>Excessive drinking can cause many heart related problems such as:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Weakening of heart muscles (alcoholic cardiomyopathy)</li>
            <li>Rapid heartbeat or irregular heart beat</li>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
         </ul>
         <br />
         <p><b>Liver</b></p>
         <p>The liver is one of the most important organs in the human body. Sometimes known as the chemical factory, it carries out essential functions that result in proper health regulation. Its primary role is the filtering of the blood by breaking down and eliminating toxins anf storing excess blood sugar. One of these “toxins” as you may have guessed is alcohol.</p>
         <p>Alcohol abuse can put a strain on the liver and damaging it causing various problems such as:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Fatty liver (accumulation of fat in the liver)</li>
            <li>Alcoholic hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)</li>
            <li>Fibrosis (scarring of the liver)</li>
            <li>Cirrhosis (irreversible scarring caused by fibrosis. Can result in liver failure)</li>
         </ul>
         <br />
         <p><b>Pancreas</b></p>
         <p>Alcohol can cause a condition called pancreatitis, a dangerous inflammation and swelling of the blood vessels in the pancreas that prevents proper digestion.</p>
         <br />
         <p><b>Cancer</b></p>
         <p>Drinking to much alcohol can result in many different cancers such as:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Mouth</li>
            <li>Throat</li>
            <li>Liver</li>
         </ul>
         <p><b>Immune System</b></p>
         <p>Excessive drinking can greatly reduce the ability of the body to protect itself. Chronic drinkers are shown to contract diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis than people who do not drink as often.
            Some studies even suggest that organ failure, such as alcoholic liver disease, may be partially caused by the body's own autoimmunity response (condition where the immune system attacks the body's own tissue).
